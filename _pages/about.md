# Biography

I'm Danrui Qi, a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate at Simon Fraser University under the supervision of [Prof. Jiannan Wang](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~jnwang/). My research interests mainly focus on `good data for AI` and `AI for good data`, which include:
- Automated data preparation, with a specific focus on the automatic augmentation of features for complex relational tables.
- Text2SQL methodologies utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), especially automating the feature preprocessing part in the AutoML workflow.
- The application of Bayesian Optimization and Reinforcement Learning techniques in the realm of Data Preparation.

Recently, I'm also very interested in Business Intelligence powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).
