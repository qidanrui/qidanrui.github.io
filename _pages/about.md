# Biography

I'm Danrui Qi, a final-year Ph.D. candidate at Simon Fraser University under the supervision of [Prof. Jiannan Wang](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~jnwang/). I also work closely with [Prof. Zhengjie Miao](https://www.miaozhengjie.com/).

Recently I am passionate about agentic AI systems, a paradigm reshaping how we tackle complex, data-intensive problems across industries. My current work focuses on building agent-powered data systems and a self-improving multi-agent scaling system, designed to enable intelligent agents to reason, plan, and collaborate in automating real-world, data-centric tasks. Through recent research, I aim to advance agentic architectures and reimagine how we design data preparation workflow and interact with data systems.

Prior to this, my research centered on automating data preparation pipelines, including automatic feature augmentation and preprocessing for tabular data. I leveraged techniques from Bayesian Optimization and AutoML to systematically address the challenges of feature engineering, demonstrating significant improvements in downstream machine learning performance across diverse datasets.

**Impact**: In my PhD, I built the DB-GPT stack (17K+ GitHub stars) and Dataprep (2K+ GitHub stars) for democratizing data science and enabling natural language interactions with databases. These systems have been deployed across data science, business intelligence, automated ML, and database applications in diverse industries. My CleanAgent framework introduced one of the first LLM-based multi-agent systems for data standardization, demonstrating how agentic architectures can automate complex data preparation tasks that traditionally required extensive domain expertise and manual effort. My research techniques such as automatic feature augmentation (ICDE 2024) and automated feature preprocessing (EDBT 2024) have contributed to advancing AutoML workflows, while my contributions to MassGen (577 GitHub stars), a multi-agent scaling system, are advancing how intelligent systems collaborate to solve complex real-world tasks at scale.
